### Original idea for my current site!

Started to experiment with markdown / markdown + JSX for a blog idea.

I *really* liked it. I hadn't yet found the UI framework I liked - by this time I had tried Material, Chakra, Semantic, all I hated it all and preferred CSS. Then I eventually found tailwind! <3
